Midterm Project 3 Code Implementation
-
Implementation for Chained Matrix Multiplication using the Yao Solution (1982), supposedly demonstrating faster time complexity than the Godbole Solution for matrix multiplication, using dynamic programming.

Chained Matrix Multiplication: Yao Solution (1982)
-
Chained Matrix Multiplication using the Yao Solution should demonstrates faster time complexity using dynamic programming.

**Time Complexity:<br>**
Yao Solution:<br>
  * T(n) = O(n^2)
  
Godbole Solution:<br>
  * T(n) = O(n^3)

Google Docs Yao Solution Lecture
-
Lecture explaining the process behind the Yao Solution for Chained Matrix Multiplication and analyzinging time and space complexity of the solution. Analysis shows the improvement of the Yao Solution from the Godbole Solution for Chained Matrix Multiplication.
